# Minimal API with ASP.NET Core
Hi there! âœŒ

This repo hosts the sample of application with MinimalAPI architecture. [CatalogApi](https://github.com/Iceblooms/MinimalAPI/tree/main/src/CatalogApi) project has convenient structure (in my opinion) and contains basic examples of usage database, DTO, DI, endpoints grouping and testing. Also, you can find there an example of usage extension methods to organize the endpoints.
