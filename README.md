# Minimal API with ASP.NET Core
Hi there! âœŒ

This repo hosts the samples of applications with MinimalAPI architecture.

## Contents
 - [CatalogApi](https://github.com/Iceblooms/MinimalAPI/tree/main/src/CatalogApi) - a minimum viable product (MVP) with convenient structure (in my opinion). This project contains basic examples of usage database, DTO, DI, endpoints grouping and testing. Also, you can find there an example of usage extension methods to organize the endpoints.
